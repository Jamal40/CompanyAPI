1. I created the databse using code first apprach using Fluent API and Data Attributes.(Models, Context)

2. I created the controllers and checked that they were working well.

3. At first I want injecting the databse in the controller's constructor. In this stage I refactored the code and applied Repository Pattern.

4. I refactored it again and made the repository generic.

5. I created a view model to help me in the Angular App and also to avoid Circular Refrencing in C#.

6. Tested the APIs again and they were working well.

7. I implemented the JWT Authentication with ASP.Core

8. Tested the authentication and they wereking well.

9. I added a flavour to the project, so I tried to consume these APIs using Angular App. 

10. Angular app is secured using ASP.Net Core Authentication.
